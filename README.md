Welcome to prophetsix.com.

This site is based on the Gatsby Simple Blog, build with Gatsby Cloud, repo'd on GitHub, CDN'd with imagekit.io, and published with Vercel.

Not much to read here... other than if you wanted to fork and run this, you would do it by running the following in your terminal/console:

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link:_ `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
