title: There is always a README

description: Why is documentation important, and how should a README file in a project actually be used
---

Getting started on any project usually entails the reading, absorbing, and repeating of a series of steps. We always hope that these steps will only ever need to be followed once, but in my experience it seems that this is hardly ever the case.

This brings us to the importance of the README. Yes, that file that hopefully contains all of the wisdom needed for you to get started and end with winning results. You may not realize it, but this file (and other forms of documentation) are actually one of the keys of success of any project. I wish I was joking, but seriously, take a look at any "well established" framework, language, or platform and you will generally find either a solid README to get the project off the ground, or a massive documentation library.

## Examples of great documentation

- Gatsby has impressive documenting resources
- NextJS has lots of docs, and an on-boarding app tutorial that lends itself to those who like collecting points (gamified docs for the win!)
- jQuery has a very well documented API that allows search and shows examples

Each of the previous examples has a few great things going for them:

- Easy to read
- Easy to follow along
- Contains examples to help solidify concepts
- Exhaustive amount of data

I think it is far too common that I run into projects (via inherited at work or from endless zombie-projects on GitHub) that have a README with literally "README Generated", or some-such drivel that actually makes me more angry, sad, and disappointed that the author chose to give me some spite-pie instead of a nice 6 course dinner.

## Things to Avoid README Files

Should you find yourself writing a project, take a moment and realize that even if you are the only one who will ever work on it you need to absolutely document how to at least stand up the project and run it. You may think that you'll remember, but you won't. You might say something like, _"this is the way it was done, and will always be done, and nothing will change that ever!"_. These are the words of a desperate developer who is too busy clinging to few bits of knowledge they have to realize that by squeezing the one thing they know and refusing to let go they are actually locking themselves in a room that will never be updated, expanded, or useful for anything else.

- Do NOT leave your README blank
- Do NOT "Platform" (soapbox, stage, politicize, statement-make) in your README, this helps no one
- Do NOT leave snide comments that if you need a readme you will never understand the project - this just lets every know that it is written poorly and you probably can't explain what it does anyway
- Do NOT leave very vague directions on how to get it going, for ex: "just run burly-hiccup install factoforce, and then mv times.conf to ../project+hope and pipe or grep to the quickloader". Yes, that is all rubbish and if it doesn't say what the requirements are, or even where to install or find them, not helpful!
